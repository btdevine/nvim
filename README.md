# Changelog

I'm trying to make minimal changes to the default LazyVim config, so any changes made will be explained here.

## 9/12/24
- Not a code-level change, but running `:MasonInstall rust-analyzer` upgrades rust-analyzer, fixing proc macro issues. Having a Mason-managed rust-analyzer is desirable so that auto-imports work properly.
